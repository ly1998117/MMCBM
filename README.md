### configuration

1. ChatGPT
   fill in the `openai_info` section in `params.py` with your own `api_key` and `api_base` from OpenAI.
2. Tencent Translation (Optional)
   fill in the `tencent_info` section in `params.py` with your own `app_id` and `app_key` from Tencent Cloud.

## Usage
### Web Interface
1. Web Interface using Gradio (Recommended), our web interface is available
   at [Interface Link](https://mmcbm.liuy.site).
2. you can also run this website locally by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash

   ```
   then open the browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:7860/` to access the website.
3. you can also build the docker image and run it:
   ```bash
   docker build -t mmcbm .
   docker run --name mmcbm -p 7860:7860 mmcbm
   ```
   then open the browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:7890` to access the website.
### Command Line
Command Line without Gradio. We also provide a bash script to run the model inference from the command line:
   ```bash
   python mmcmb_inference.py
   ```
