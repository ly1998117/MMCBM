## üëÄ Introduction
This is the official repository for **A Concept-based Interpretable Model for the Diagnosis of Choroid Neoplasias using Multimodal Data**
This study introduces a multimodal concept-based interpretable model (MMCBM) tailored to distinguish uveal melanoma 
(0.4-0.6 per million in Asians) from hemangioma and metastatic carcinoma following the clinical practise. We collected 
the largest dataset on Asians to date on choroid neoplasm imaging, encompassing over 750 patients from 2013 to 2019. 
Our model integrates domain expert insights from radiological reports and differentiates between three types of choroidal 
tumors, achieving an $F_1$ score of 0.91.

## üîç Dataset
To support the development of interpretable models for diagnosing choroidal tumors, 
we built the Choroid Tri-Modal Imaging (CTI) dataset, an anonymized, multimodal, 
and annotated collection of medical images from Beijing Tongren Hospital encompassing Fluorescence Angiography (FA), 
Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA), and Ocular Ultrasound (US) images. 
The construction of this dataset was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital.

**License**:
```
CTI dataset is only used for academic research. Commercial use in any form is prohibited.
The copyright of the dataset belongs to Beijing Tongren Hospital.
Without prior approval, you cannot distribute, publish, copy, disseminate, or modify CTI in whole or in part. 
You must strictly comply with the above restrictions.
```


## Installation

1. Create a conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. Install from the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Preparation

üìç**download**
download the checkpoint from the [model checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YwDhqC_M9ACBnGjn_8IZouWHgJx1ue5Q?usp=drive_link), and put it in the `work_dir/result` directory. 
After downloading, the directory structure should look like this:
 + backbone: pretrained encoders trained on the same dataset split as MMCBM. Put the backbone in 
   ```bash
    work_dir/result/Efficientb0_SCLS_attnscls_CrossEntropy_32
   ```
 + MMCBM (Optional): the checkpoint of the MMCBM model. Put the MMCBM in
   ```bash
   work_dir/result/CAV_m2CBM_sigmoid_C0.1CrossEntropy_32_report_strict_aow_zero_MM_max
   ```


üìç ‚öôÔ∏è**configuration**
+ ChatGPT
   fill in the `openai_info` section in `params.py` with your own `api_key` and `api_base` from OpenAI. 
+ Tencent Translation (Optional)
   fill in the `tencent_info` section in `params.py` with your own `app_id` and `app_key` from Tencent Cloud.
## ‚ôªÔ∏è Training
To train the MMCBM, you should first download our CTI dataset and put it in the `<work dir>/data` directory. 
And then download the pre-trained backbone and put it in the `<work dir>/result/Efficientb0_SCLS_attnscls_CrossEntropy_32` directory.
Then you can run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
    python train_CAV_CBM.py --name <dirname of experiment> --backbone <backbone dir> --epoch 200 --lr 1e-3 --device 0 --bz 8 --k 0
```

For five-fold cross-validation, you can run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
    python execute_concept.py --name <dirname of experiment>  --bz 8  --backbone <backbone dir> --clip_name cav --device 1,2,3,4,5 --k 0,1,2,3,4,5 --lr 0.001
```

## üîÆ Usage
üìç **Web Interface**
1. Web Interface using Gradio (Recommended), our web interface is available
   at [Interface Link](https://mmcbm.liuy.site).
2. you can also run this website locally by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python web_interface.py
   ```
   then open the browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:7860/` to access the website.

3. We also provide a human evaluation website, used for doctors to diagnose the disease based on the model's prediction.
   + For blackbox model:
       ```bash
       python web_human_blackbox_evaluation.py
       ```
   + For MMCBM model:
       ```bash
       python web_human_mmcbm_evaluation.py
       ```
   then open the browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:7890` to access the website.

üìç**Command Line :**

Command Line without Gradio. We also provide a bash script to run the model inference from the command line:
   ```bash
   python mmcmb_inference.py
   ```
